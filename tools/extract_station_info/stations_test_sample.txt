A number of stations continue to bear obsolete early names where these form part of the physical architecture. For example, the platform wall tiling at [[Arsenal tube station|Arsenal]], [[Hampstead tube station|Hampstead]], [[Marylebone station|Marylebone]] and [[Warren Street tube station|Warren Street]] still carries the original names of these stations.</ref>
